# ML-Project--handwritten-digits-dataset
Handwritten digits dataset which has images of size 8×8 (64 dimensional).


For dataset, you can use ’load digits’ from sklearn.datasets.

1.Used sklearn’s t-SNE algorithm and reduce this 64-dimensional data to 2 dimensions (2-D).

2.Implemented the algorithm taking perplexity = 30 and number of iterations = 1000

3.Visualized the reduced 2-D data as a scatter plot.

4.Fixed perplexity to 30, repeated the algorithm with number of iterations = 100 and 2000. Observed the scatter plots.
